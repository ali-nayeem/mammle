Alignment has 779 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 70.95%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
Alignment Patterns: 779
Name: No Name Provided
DataType: AA
Substitution Matrix: WAG
Using empirical base frequencies
